 * The goal of the HEARTS game is to avoid
 * receiving hearts. In this game 4 players receive 13 cards each. The first
 * player in each round sets the suit and the other players in turn must follow
 * that suit, if they can. In the end of the round, the player that played the
 * highest card of the suit to follow picks all the cards. In the first two
 * rounds the suit to follow cannot be hearts. In the end of the game, the
 * player that picked less hearts wins the game.
