 * <h2>Package wcg.games.war Description</h2>
 * War is a very simple card game, mostly played by children. Both players peek a card and place it on the table simultaneously (not in turns). The cards with higher value wins and the player collects both cards that are added to the end of his hand. If the cards have equal value then it's war: both players peek 3 cards and wins the one with higher value. If the values are again equal then it's a new war. The game ends when a player runs out of cards to play.
