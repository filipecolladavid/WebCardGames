<h2>Package wcg.main Description</h2>
Classes for managing the web card game service. Manager is the main class and exposes methods called remotely by the web clients. It has a single instance that provides a single access point to this package, thus following both the Singleton and Facade design patterns.

The rest of the classes manage users and game instances. The UserPool class manages users and is serializable, thus ensuring that user data is persisted and can be recovered if the system is restarted.
